I have obtained a Ph.D. at <a href='https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html'>The Chinese University of Hong Kong</a> and a B.Eng at <a href='https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/'>Sun Yat-Sen University</a>. I developed interdisciplinary skillsets in both machine learning and system engineering.

My current research focuses on using cutting-edge machine learning to model monitoring metrics and improve the reliability and performance of cloud computing systems.

Till October 2022, I have published papers in top conferences, including ASE, DSN, ICDCS, WWW, ISSRE, etc. Besides, I have also spent time at Microsoft Research Asia, Huawei Cloud, and Ant Financial as a research intern/data analyst intern.
